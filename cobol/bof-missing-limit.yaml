    message: >-
      Detected COBOL code that seems vulnerable to Buffer Overflow due the absence of controls to limit the size of untrusted data when storing it.
      It is suggested to inspect the affected code, in case the vulnerability is confirmed a proper data validation to limit the size of user controlled data should be implemented before storing it.
