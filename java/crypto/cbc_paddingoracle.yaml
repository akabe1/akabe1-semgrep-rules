  message: >-
    This Java application uses a weak cipher, the data encrypted using CBC mode block with PKCS5 and
    PKCS7 paddings results vulnerable to Padding Oracle attack, which could allow to retrieve its
    plain-text value.
    It is suggested to switch from CBC mode to an authenticated encryption mode like GCM or
    OCB; otherwise if CBC usage is required adopt cypertext authentication via MACs (like HMAC).
