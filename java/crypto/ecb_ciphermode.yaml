  message: >-
    This Java application uses a weak cipher, the data encrypted using EBC mode block results vulnerable
    to various cryptographic attacks, which could allow to retrieve its plain-text value (note that when
    none mode is specified by default ECB is used). 
    Note that RSA/ECB ciphers are not vulnerable and should be considered a false positive,
    this is due to the fact that RSA is not a block cipher and this configuration corresponds to RSA/NONE.
    It is recommended to avoid the use of ECB mode.
