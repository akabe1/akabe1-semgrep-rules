  message: >-
    This Java application uses a weak cipher that does not guarantee integrity protection. 
    The data encrypted using ciphers like CBC, OFB, CTR or ECB mode block, is susceptible to
    alteration by an attacker, because these cipher modes do not provide a way to
    detect if data is tampered.
    It is suggested to use a cipher that includes a HMAC to sign the data.
