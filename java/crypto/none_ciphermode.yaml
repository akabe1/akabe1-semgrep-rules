  message: >-
    This Java application does not specifies a cipher mode block when instatiating a new cipher. 
    This means that implicitly is adopted a cipher-provider specific cipher mode, which for 
    the majority of the Java cipher-provider is the deprecated ECB mode.
    Data encrypted using EBC mode block results vulnerable to various cryptographic attacks,
    which could allow to retrieve its plain-text value. 
    It is recommended to use transformations that fully specify not weak values for the algorithm, 
    mode, and padding instead of relying on the defaults.
