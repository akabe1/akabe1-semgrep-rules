      This iOS mobile application seems containing some hardcoded information, this storage mode
      is insecure because does not guarantee the confidentiality of data.
      An attacker could be able to retrieve the hardcoded data from the code of iOS mobile
      application. 
      When saving reserved data into the device, it is recommended to adopt any of the encryption
      methods/tools internationally recognized as strong for iOS (adapt to the specific mobile
      application context).
