      This iOS mobile application seems using an insecure WebView in-app browser, which could expose
      to various kind of vulnerabilities.
      More specifically, the usage of the deprecated UIWebView should be avoided, because it
      suffers of various security issues. Also the usage of SFSafariViewController should be avoided in
      sensitive contexts, because it presents various potential security flaws (i.e. JavaScript disabling
      not supported, cookies and other data shared with Safari browser, etc.).
      An attacker could abuse this issue to perform various kind of injection attacks (like: XSS, code
      injection, stealing of reserved information, etc.).
      It is recommended to use the WKWebView component properly configured in the mobile app, if the usage
      of SFSafariViewController is a requirements, it is suggested to adopt it only in trusted contexts.
