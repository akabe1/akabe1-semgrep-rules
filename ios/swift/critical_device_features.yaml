      This iOS mobile application seems calling critical device features (like: send SMS, make phone call,
      or send email) during its functioning. 
      Given the sensitivity of these features developers must take caution when using them, because
      theyir misuse could expose the users to various kind of attacks (i.e. sending reserved data via
      cleartext SMS, spamming via emails/SMS, unintended phone call frauds, etc.).
